Hi there, I'm Arhan. Check out my [website](https://arhan.sh) for more info about me.

I am a student and a programming hobbyist. You'll find me pursing a variety of different programming endeavors, ranging from [designing esotetic computers](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/qter), [app development](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/TimeWeb), [Advent of Code](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/advent-of-code-2023), and [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/team/207689). I try to learn something new with every project, and you can check out some of my pinned repositories for more info about what I've been working on!
